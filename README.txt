// Facility-, instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:To conduct the experiment, we installed a container on the floor of the enclosure. Subsequently, we filled the container with clean water and included four species of floating aquatic plants (Azolla filiculoides Lam, Salvinia minima Bak, Lemna valdiviana Fil., and Wolffia columbiana Karsten) until they covered the water surface, totaling 1,304.1 cm². The aquatic plants were made available to the capybara for 26 hours and 30 minutes, with which the capybara can interact at ad libitum. The number of aquatic plants added to the container was estimated by counting all individuals in 12 random samples using an 8.55 cm² sampler. Counts of individuals were performed using a Zeiss Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope. The mean and standard error were calculated for each species of aquatic plant based on these 12 samples. The values were extrapolated to estimate the population in the container. Before the experiment, no aquatic plants were detected in the enclosure.We analyzed the dispersion of intact aquatic plants by capybaras through the digestive tract (endozoochory) and via fur over short distances (epizoochory). For endozoochory, we collected all fecal samples produced during 48 hours after the provision of aquatic plants. During this period, a total of eight fecal samples were collected, taken to the laboratory, and washed under running tap water using stacked sieves with mesh sizes of 2 mm, 1 mm, 500 µm, and 250 µm. The retained aquatic plants were examined under a Zeiss Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope and incubated separately in Petri dishes with filtered water from Zoo lake. The aquatic plants were kept in a greenhouse to assess their viability for 21 days. Throughout this period, the temperature ranged from 13°C to 29°C. Mortality and emergence of new aquatic plants were recorded every seven days during the incubation period. Epizoochory dispersion was verified by observing the presence of aquatic plants in the pool area of the enclosure after 24 hours of the experiment.
